# Notes from October 18, 2016 meeting

## Tobi, MH

## What we have so far

- Experiment 1 in CogSci paper: 
    + some patterns of evidence 
    + question about one character's strength 

- Experiment 2 in CogSci paper: 
    + patterns of evidence 
    + direct evidence about laziness 
    + question about one character's strength 

## Future experiments: 

### Experiment 3: Same model - new questions
- keep the same model we already have but ask different questions: 
    + strength: How strong do you think player A is? 
    + laziness: 
        * How lazy do you think player A is (overall)?
        * Do you think player A was lazy in game 2? 
    + winning (prediction): Do you think player A will win against player B? 
    + winning (counterfactual): Do you think player A would have won if he hadn't been lazy? 
    + responsibility: To what extent was player A responsible for the team win/loss?
    + counterfactual:  Would team X still have won without player A (or if player A had been lazy)? 

### Experiment 4: Agent model 
- agents in the game make decisions about how much effort they should exert 
- rational effort expenditure: 
    + only put in effort if I believe that this will make a (sufficient) difference to my chances of winning 
    + what's at stake (important game vs. practice game)
    + how much do I care about the others in my team (more likely to exert effort if I care about the others in my team: as their utilities become part of my utilities)
- same questions as above (maybe with a focus on effort)

### Experiment 5: Language 
- include a commentator who gives direct evidence about relevant latent variables 
            
## Other things discussed: 

- possibility for complementarity of skills $\rightarrow$ two players aren't great individually but very good together
