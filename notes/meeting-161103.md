# Notes from 11/03/2016 meeting

## Model comparison 

- generate patterns for which we get different predictions comparing a regression model, a full model, and a model that has no concept of laziness 

## Experiment 1 plan 

- game patterns
- potentially: information by the commentator about laziness (and strength?)
- questions: 
    + strength of a player 
    + laziness in a particular game 
    + who will be the winner of the next match 

## To do list 

- MH: generate an interface that allows for playing around with different situations and outputting the model predictions 
- TG: make a pipeline for reading in data, and anonymizing data
