		<p>Your task in this experiment is to infer, based on the information given to you, information about players in hypothetical tug-of-war games.</p>
		<p>In each scenario, you will see the outcomes of a number of such games. The members of each team in a game will be shown in boxes. A crown will appear next to the team that
		won each game. You can hover over a player to highlight his or her appearances in the scenario, and you can click on the player to display the games in which he or she participated.</p>
		<p>You may receive additional information about the matches from a commentator, which will appear on the side of the screen. Always take this information to be true.</p>
		<p>You will be asked to answer questions about players' strength and laziness. Strength can be thought of as a number. If the sum of the strengths of Team Blue are greater than the sum of the strengths of Team Red, then Team Blue wins. A player's strength remains the same throughout each scenario (but not necessarily across scenarios).</p>
		<p>If a player is lazy in a certain game, then he or she only tries half as hard and therefore his or her strength is decreased by half. However, a player can be lazy in one game and then try hard in the next.</p>

		<p style="font-size:18px; text-align: center; margin-top:1em;"><b>Outcome</b>: The policy was <b> passed</b>.</p><p style="font-size:17px; text-align: center;"> 3 out of 4 committee members voted in favor of the policy and at least 2 votes were required for the policy to pass.</p>
		<hr />
		<p>In this example, the vote was about policy #123187 which was supported by the Republican party. 4 politicians were in the committee. In order for the policy to be passed, at least 2 committee members were required to vote for it.</p>

		<p><b>John</b>, a Republican, voted for the policy. So did <b>Bill</b>, also a Republican. <b>Steve</b>, a Democrat, didn't vote for the policy. <b>Robert</b>, another Democrat, voted in favor of the policy.</p>

		<p>Since 3 out of 4 committee members voted for the policy and 2 votes were required for the policy to pass, the policy was accepted.</p> 

		<p>Each of the committee members knows the following information before they make a decision whether to vote for the policy:</p>

		<ol type="a">
			<li>the number of people in the committee</li>
			<li>the minimum number of votes required for the policy to pass</li>
			<li>each politician's political affiliation</li>
			<li>whether the policy is supported by the Democratic or Republican party</li>
		</ol>

		<p>In the experiment, you will judge to what extent different committee members are responsible for whether or not a given policy was passed.</p>
